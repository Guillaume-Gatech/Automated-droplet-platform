Main.vi file is the GUI used for running the platform and shown in SI Fig. 5.
The folders "Camera subVI", "Communication with pressure boxes", and "Import commands from excel file" contain subVIs called in the Main.vi program.
The folder "Phenotyping" contains VIs used for analyzing the animal's movement. For "in-situ" phenotyping, such as during the mock screen, the VI must be wired inside the Main.vi program to process the movies.
Furthermore, the remaining VIs and driver libraries of the Main.vi file can be found here:
